# MDS-Core Security Standards
## Pre-Commit
For the protection of all developers who contribute to MDS-Core, we require all commits to be screened by the open source [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com) tool prior to entering the git history. This prevents things like AWS secret keys from being checked into the repo.
